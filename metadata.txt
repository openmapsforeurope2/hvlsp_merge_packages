about=The Open Maps for Europe 2 (OME2) project aims at providing a high-value large-scale dataset, which can be downloaded as geopackages covering countries or regions. This plugin, developed by IGN-France on behalf of the OME2 project, aims at merging such gpkg files in order to get one seamless geopackage. OME2 has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Digital Europe programme under grant agreement No 101100625.
